# minecraft-charms
This repository contains Java code for a Paper 1.20.6 (Build #112) Minecraft server plugin to add custom charms.

## What the project does

Charms are items that, when placed in the nine slots in a player's hotbar, confer potion effects continuously to that player. This plugin implements charms for Minecraft servers and allows for the addition of custom charms.

## Why the project is useful

Currently, no plugins implement charms or charm-like items in an easy way. Server staff can achieve the same effect with other plugins, but only after cumbersome changes.
